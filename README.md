## Feedback

#### Likes
- Dark mode stored across pages
- Styling of elements, particularly spacing
- input validation with popup text under publish button
- Animation on labels for inputs after typing
- code is clear and readable on both client and server

#### Would be better if
- More navigation, particularly posts already made (instead of inputting id manually)
- Bit more content on readme file
- responsiveness has elements shrinking/disappearing slightly
- fonts inconsistent between some inputs (personal choice)
- search could have button

All in all, really like the look and feel of the website
